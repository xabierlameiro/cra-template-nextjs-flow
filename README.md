# cra-template-nextjs-flow

This is the unofficial Nextjs and Flow template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

- Nextjs with headers configured
- Flow with flow-typed for next and react types
- Jest and testing-library with test-utils
- Prettier configuration
- Eslint with standar configuration
- Husky config precommit lint-staged
- Vscode with my personal configuration and snippets

To use this template, add `--template nextjs-flow` when creating a new app.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template nextjs-flow

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template nextjs-flow
```
